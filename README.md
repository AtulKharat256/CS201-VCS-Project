# **Simple Version Control System**

This project is a lightweight, custom-built Version Control System (VCS) inspired by Git, enabling efficient management of code repositories, collaborative development, and streamlined version control operations.

## üöÄ **Core Features**

- **Repository Initialization:** Start a fresh repository to track your code versions from scratch.
- **Branch Management:**
  - **Create:** Set up new branches to experiment with features or work on bug fixes independently.
  - **Switch (Checkout):** Seamlessly navigate between branches to focus on specific parts of your project.
  - **Delete:** Remove branches that are no longer relevant or needed.
- **Merging Options:**
  - **Fast-Forward Merge:** Integrate branch changes quickly if no diverging changes exist.
  - **Three-Way Merge:** Resolve and merge conflicts when branches diverge, ensuring consistency.
- **Stashing Support:** Temporarily save uncommitted changes to clear your workspace, with the option to restore them later.
- **Staging Area:** Organize and review changes in a staging area before committing them to the repository.

## üìö **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local environment.
   ```shell
   gh repo clone AtulKharat256/CS201-VCS-Project
2. Unzip the files and navigate to the src folder.
   Run first.cpp to launch the VCS.
   If prompted with errors about the filesystem library, update your compiler (e.g., with MYSYS2) or add filesystem support manually in C++.
   Specify a working directory (anywhere outside src), and provide your username for commits.
3. Initialize a Repository:
   Run the init command to create a new repository
   atom-init
4. Stage Files: Add files to the staging area with relative paths only.
   atom-add example.txt
5. Commit Changes: Commit staged files to the repository with a descriptive message.
   atom-commit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Internal Folder**: When initializing, a `.git` folder is created in your working directory to store VCS internals.
- **Single-Directory Limitation**: The `variables` directory links the source code in `src` to your working directory, so you‚Äôll need to create a fresh `src` copy if you want to start a new working directory.

## üîß Project Limitations
- **File Tracking**: This VCS currently tracks only files in the specified working directory and not in subdirectories.
- **Error Handling**: Limited error handling; ensure commands are used correctly as described.
- **Three-Way Merge Limitation**: During three-way merges, an external editor (like Notepad on Windows) will open to resolve conflicts, but it may not appear in screen recordings.

## üß© Project Structure
This VCS consists of various C++ modules working together to create a streamlined version control experience. Key modules include:

- **Branching and Merging**: Efficient branch creation, deletion, and merging functionality with options for fast-forward and three-way merges.
- **Staging and Committing**: Manage your code's lifecycle from staging changes to final commits.
- **File Management**: Handles file storage and retrieval within a `.git`-like structure for easy tracking and versioning.
