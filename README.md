# **Our own baby Version Control System (ATOM)**

This project is a lightweight, custom-built Version Control System (VCS) inspired by Git, enabling efficient management of code repositories, collaborative development, and streamlined version control operations.

## ðŸš€ **Core Features**

- **Repository Initialization**: Start a fresh repository to track your code versions from scratch.
- **Branch Management**:
  - **Create**: Set up new branches to experiment with features or work on bug fixes independently.
  - **Switch (Checkout)**: Seamlessly navigate between branches to focus on specific parts of your project.
  - **Delete**: Remove branches that are no longer relevant or needed.
- **Merging Options**:
  - **Fast-Forward Merge**: Integrate branch changes quickly if no diverging changes exist.
  - **Three-Way Merge**: Resolve and merge conflicts when branches diverge, ensuring consistency.
- **Stashing Support**: Temporarily save uncommitted changes to clear your workspace, with the option to restore them later.
- **Staging Area**: Organize and review changes in a staging area before committing them to the repository.

## ðŸ“š **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- C++ compiler (supporting the `<filesystem>` library).
- `MYSYS2` or similar to handle C++17/20 libraries.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
     Clone this repository to your local environment.
  
     ```shell
     gh repo clone AtulKharat256/CS201-VCS-Project
2. **Set Up Directory and Run:

    Navigate to the `CS201-VCS-Project` folder.  
    Compile and run `main.cpp` to launch the VCS.
    
    ```shell
    g++ main.cpp -o vcs -lstdc++fs
    ./vcs
3. **Specify a Working Directory:

    Upon running, you will be asked to specify a working directory and username for commits.
    Ensure the working directory is outside the CS201-VCS-Project folder.
###Example Workflow

1. **Initialize a Repository**:
    Start by running the init command to create a new repository:
    ```shell
    atom-init
2. **Stage files**:
    Add files to the staging area. Use relative paths only.
    ```shell
    atom-add example.txt
3. **Commit Changes**:
    Commit staged files with a descriptive message.
    ```shell
    atom-commit
4. **Branching and Merging**:
    Create, switch, and delete branches, or use merging options as needed.
    ```shell
    atom-branch
    atom-checkout
    atom-merge ffm master
###Command Menu

Commands available after launching include:

  Branch: atom-branch <branch_name>
  Checkout: atom-checkout <branch_name>
  Delete Branch: atom-delete <branch_name>
